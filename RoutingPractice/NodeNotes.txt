NodJS Lifecycle

You start your program via node app.js, this will start the node server
After the script start it will then parse the code, register variables and functions
Then all code is managed by the event loop
This keeps on running as long as there are event listeners registered, such at the app.listen
Only way for it to stop is to cntrol c on the terminal or somewhere in the code write process.exit();
